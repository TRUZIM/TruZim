<h3 id="4" class="small">Matobo National Park</h3>
<p class="city">This breathtaking and timeless landscape of exposed granite outcrops - sculpted and shaped by the elements of nature to create an area of outstanding natural beauty - has enchanted Ndebele kings and European visitors alike.
The Park includes an Intensive Protection Zone where a large population of Black and White Rhinoceros are successfully breeding. The Park offers a diverse package of tourist attractions and activities.</p>
<p class="city">The park is situated in the magnificent Matobo Hills, a range of domes, spires and balancing rock formations which have been hewn out of the solid granite plateau through millions of years of erosion and weathering. The majestic and rugged terrain of the park is a hikers paradise and the diversity of the vegetation supports a wide range of wildlife.
Matobo meaning 'bald heads' was the name chosen for the area by the great Ndebele King, Mzilikazi. He is buried in the Matobo Hills just a short distance from the park.</p>
<p class="city">Matobo National Park is also the site of the grave of Cecil John Rhodes. He is buried at the summit of Malindidzimu -' hill of benevolent spirits'. He referred to this hill as having a 'View of the World'. A short walk from the parking lot will lead the visitor to his grave, which is carved out of the solid granite hill and surrounded by a natural amphitheatre of massive boulders.</p>

He called it 'View of the World' and decided that this was to be his burial place. Rhodes Grave offers fabulous views over the Matapos.</p>
<p class="city">Cecil John Rhodes is buried at the top of Malindidzimu, known to the local tribes as "the hill of spirits" and to Rhodes as "World's View". There is the most incredible view out over the extensive hills from the top of the hill. Other early white settlers such as Sir Leander Starr Jameson are also buried there and there is a memorial to the Shangani patrol, who were killed in a battle between white settlers and the Ndebele people. Visitors will be guided to the top of what is a steep climb by a park ranger who will explain the different viewpoints that can be seen from the top.</p>

<h3 id="4" class="small">The Mzilikazi Memorial</h3> 
<p class="city">Mzilikazi is today acclaimed by many as the father of the amaNdebele nation and the greatest leader this country has ever had.

While his journey had begun with a few hundred followers, under Mzilikazi's leadership the tribe’s numbers had risen to, at their peak, some 20,000 people as conquered peoples were absorbed into the amaNdebele nation.

Mzilikazi's greatest success was infusing his diverse population with a sense of common nationhood, one shared by the amaNdebele community today.

During Mzilikazi’s reign there were four different capitals (Gibxhegu, Mahlokohloko, Inyathi and Mhlahlandleia.</p>

 

<h4 class="distance">How to get here:</h4> 
<p class="city">From Bulawayo take the Matopos road and then take the Old Gwanda Road. Distances are from the Matopos / old Gwanda road intersection. At 14.5 KM the Mzilikazi Memorial is just off the Old Gwanda road on your right. </p>

<p class="city">Located in Prospect Avenue, off Josiah Chinamano and behind the OK Mart.</p>

<h3 id="4" class="small">Khami Ruins</h3>
<p class="city">Khami is a ruined city in Zimbabwe. It was once the capital of the Kingdom of Butua of the Torwa dynasty. It is located 22 kilometers west of the modern city of Bulawayo, capital of the province of Matabeleland North. Its ruins are now a national monument in Zimbabwe. Khami is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p class="city">Khami was the capital of the Torwa dynasty for about 200 years from around 1450 and appears to have been founded at the time of the disappearance of the state at Great Zimbabwe. After that, (the traditional date is 1683), it was ransacked by Changamire Dombo who led an army of Rozvi rebels from the Mwenemutapa/Monomotapa State. Excavations seem to show that the site was not occupied after these Rozvi took over. The Rozvi made another Khami phase site, Danamombe (Dhlo-Dhlo), their new capital. In the 1830s Nguni speaking Ndebele raiders displaced them from Khami and many of the other sites they had established.</p>
<p class="city">The site of Khami reveals seven built-up areas occupied by the royal family with open areas in the valley occupied by the commoners. The complex comprises circular, sometimes terraced, artificial platforms encased by dry stone walls. The beautifully decorated 6m-high by 68m-long retaining wall of the precipice platform bears a checkerboard design along its entire length. The platforms, rising 2–7m above the ground, carried dhaka (clay) huts and courtyards where those of status lived. The remnants of cattle kraals and huts for ordinary people can be seen below the Hill complex The ruins include a royal enclosure or Hill Complex, which had to be on higher ground than other buildings, stone walls and hut platforms, and also a Christian cross believed to have been placed by a contemporary missionary. There are also ruins on the eastern side of the Khami River. Other platforms are believed to have been cattle kraals and a retaining wall with a chequered pattern. Recent excavations (2000-2006) have revealed that the walls of the western parts of the Hill Complex were all decorated in chequer, herringbone, cord, as well as variegated stone blocks.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="distance">How to get here:</h4>
<p class="city">From Bulawayo centre take Thirteenth Avenue and follow the full tarmac road passing Northgate shopping Centre. 20 KM turn right at the signpost for Khame Ruins; 22 KM reach the Site Museum. Apart from the last couple of Kilometres, the road is tarred.</p>

<p class="city">The site covers 35 hectares, so it is worth taking a picnic and spending half a day exploring the site.

			<h2 id="5" class="town">Chakari</h2>
			<p class="city">Chakari is a mining village in the province of Mashonaland West, Zimbabwe. It is located about 33 km west of Chegutu and 38 km north of Kadoma.The village grew up around the Turkois Mine in 1907 and was named after the mine. In 1911 it was renamed Shagari but the name was changed again in 1923 to its current name, Chakari. Gold is still mined at the Dalny Mine which is one of Zimbabwe's largest producers of gold. Maize, wheat, sorghum, barley and cotton are grown in the area. This area has red soil that is high is minerals that makes it great for farming crops.<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
			   
			<h2 id="6" class="town">Chegutu</h2>
			<p class="city">Chegutu is a town in Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe.The town is located in Chegutu District, Mashonaland West, in central northern Zimbabwe. It lies in the Hartley Hills 107 kilometres (66 mi), southwest of the capital Harare .Chegutu lies on the A5 highway between Harare and Bulawayo. It is also on the railway line between the two cities. Secondary roads link it to Chinhoyi, Chakari and the Mhondoro communal lands.</p>
			   
			<p class="city">Chegutu is the commercial and administrative centre of the surrounding district. Having been established as a mining settlement by gold prospectors, mining for gold and nickel remains important in the area. Its agricultural economy was developed significantly after the Second World War, with maize and cotton becoming major crops. One of Zimbabwe's largest textile mills was established there. Wheat is grown with the aid of irrigation from the nearby Mupfure River, and cattle rearing is also a significant activity. The Cotton and Grain Marketing Boards established depots in Chegutu for cotton and grain respectively, and by 1984 sixteen grain silos had been built in the town for the bulk storage and delivery of grain.
            The town has 12 large grain silos, each capable of holding 5,000 tons of grain, but most are unused.</p>

<h3 id="6" class="small">The Restaurant that never took off</h3>
<p class="city">This site does not require that you even stop your car and get out to see the two Vickers Viscounts mounted on their concrete plinths slap bang in the middle of the Central Park; Chegutu’s equivalent of New York’s Central Park, or London’s Hyde Park.</p>

<p class="city">Someone around March 1997 managed to produce a business plan that convinced Chegutu’s Mayoral Council, Air Zimbabwe and the corporate sponsers Coca-Cola that their business proposition was viable and would attract diners from the surrounding area to dine at this unusually fashionable international venue.</p>

<p class="city">It did not work  and these relics from a marvellous former flying age (1959 and 1961) have been left as forlorn wrecks outside Chegutu town

It does not seem a fitting end for Vickers Viscount C/N 436 that was once used by the Shah of Iran and later flew HM the Queen Mother on her 1965 Royal tour of Australia.

Somehow I cannot see these aeroplanes getting back their Certificates of Airworthiness anytime soon.</p>

<h4 class="distance">How to get here:</h4> 
<p class="city">From Chegutu (formerly Hartley) take the A5 national road west towards Kadoma (formerly Gatooma) The Vickers Viscounts are on the left hand side of the 200 metres after you leave the last of the main street shops.

			   <h2 id="8" class="town">Chimanimani</h2>
			   <p class="city">Chimanimani District (part of which was known as Melsetter 1895–1982) is a mountainous area in the province of Manicaland, eastern Zimbabwe. The region is distinguished by large peaks, carved from a rifted quartzite block, the highest reaching to 2,440 m (8,005 ft) and stretching for some 50 km (31 mi), forming the border with Mozambique. Between the village of Chimanimani and the border the ranges are gentler and more rounded. The national park is in the southernmost area of the Eastern Highlands, and is 150 km (93 mi) from the town Mutare (known as Umtali until 1982).</p>
			   
			   <h3 id="8" class="small">Chimanimani National Park</h3>
<p class="city">The border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique runs north / south along the highest peaks of the Chimanimani’s. These mountains are really for those who like to explore by foot and feel the grandeur and majesty of being alone in a wild place. ZPWMA say they have a deliberate policy to limit development within the National Park to preserve its natural, pristine beauty and the wild landscapes of this mountainous area.</p>

<p class="city">For walkers’ familiar with the south-western Cape the Chimanimani feels and looks very similar, the difference being that Chimanimani has far fewer visitors and a much greater sense of isolation and a feeling of being very much in touch with wild nature.</p>

<p class="city">The Chimanimani National Park also includes the Eland Sanctuary. It is a mountainous terrain with peak heights of 2,436 metres (7,992 feet) and is the source of many streams and springs and natural falls such as in the Bridal Veil Falls in the Eland Sanctuary and spectacular views of the Pork Pie Mountain Range.</p>

<p class="city">Wildlife in the Chimanimani National Park is not abundant, but includes species such as eland, sable, bushbuck and blue duiker, and less frequently seen are klipspringer and leopard.</p>   

 

<h4 class="distance">How to get here:</h4>
<p class="city">From Mutare take the A9 Chimanimani Road heading south, 66.5 KM turn left onto the A10, 79.5 KM turn right and continue on the A10, 129.60 KM turn left for Chimanimani village, 148.30 KM reach Chimanimani village, 165.5 KM reach ZPWMA base camp.</p>
			   
			   <h3 id="8" class="small">Bridal Veil Falls, Chimanimani</h3>
<p class="city">Bridal Veil Falls is an ideal picnic site within easy walking distance from the Chimanimani Village. Tucked away at the base of high cliffs, where time seems to stop and all that’s to be heard are birds singing and the water trickling over rocks into a crystal clear pool. If you feel brave, take a swim in the icy waters where many thankful mountain walkers have dipped their tired feet.</p>

<h4 class="distance">How to get here:</h4> 
<p class="city">From Mutare take the A9 Chimanimani Road heading south, 66.5 KM turn left onto the A10 Road, 79.5 KM turn right and continue on the A10, 129.60 KM turn left for Chimanimani, 148.30 KM reach Chimanimani village, 151.0 KM reach Bridal Veil Falls.

The Caves consist of a system of tunnels and caverns. This system is a dying one (in geological time spans), in that they are slowly collapsing. These collapses can be noticed by the sink holes and depressions within the surrounding area. The Wonder Hole, which is the main feature of the Caves, is in fact a "swallow hole" or a large cavern with a collapsed roof.
The walls or sides of the Wonder Hole drop vertically down for 150 feet to the Sleeping Pool. The pool is unbelievably blue and crystal clear which reflects great depth and non-flowing water.</p>

  <p class="city">Gweru is a city near the centre of Zimbabwe. It is the administrative capital of the Midlands Province, one of ten provinces in Zimbabwe. It became a municipality in 1914 and achieved city status in 1971. The name changed from Gwelo to Gweru in 1982. Before becoming a municipality, Gweru was known as "The Steep Place" after the Gweru river's high banks when it was first settled by the Matabele. Founded in 1894 by Dr. Leander Starr Jameson, modern Gweru was initially established as a military outpost. The Nalatale and Danangombe archaeological enclosures lie nearby, the former known for its patterned brickwork, the latter for its Portuguese remains. The remains at these sites date back to as early as the Torwa state during the 17th century, the most substantial being a four hundred-year-old stone wall decorated with motifs known to the tradition of stone-building in Zimbabwe. The surrounding area has rich deposits of gold, chrome, iron, asbestos and platinum and supports several mines. Gweru has become one of Africa's busiest trade centers thanks to its production of textiles, dairy foods, footwear, and building materials.</p> 
  
  <p class="city">Railways arrived in Gweru in 1902. National Railways of Zimbabwe have the country's largest marshalling yard, Dabuka, on the south side of Gweru. Dabuka plays a pivotal role in rail movement in the country as it is the central hub of the rail links to Mozambique in the east, South Africa in the south and Botswana and Namibia in the south west, lying on the Bulawayo - Harare Line.</p>

Road names used are by destination only, for example the Harare-Gweru Road. There are only mainroads, no highways or freeways.

Gweru shares an international relationship with the town of Basildon, (Essex, United Kingdom). And Manchester, New Hampshire.

The Boggie Clock Tower, located at the intersection of Main Street and Robert Mugabe Way, was built in 1928 in memory of Major William James Boggie. The clock tower is one of the city's most famous landmarks.

The town has museums and one can go on safaris and camping.</p>

<h3 id="16" class="small">Gweru Memorial (Matabele uprising, or First Umvukela, 1896)</h3>
<p class="city">Various Memorials were set up by the Rhodesian Memorial Fund in 1896 with the purpose of commemorating those military and civilians who were killed in the Matabele Uprising, or First Umvukela of 1896. The Funds also had the aim of providing for those who were wounded, or made destitute and the wider aim of providing libraries, museums and hospitals.</p>

<ol class="ordered">

 <p class="city">In an article in Rhodesiana No. 22 called Memorials: Matabele Rebellion 1896 (P16-19) by C.K. Cooke, he states there were four Memorials erected at outlying points in Matabeleland by the Rhodesian Memorial Fund as follows:</p>

   <li class="city">Pongo (National Monument No. 33) near Shangani. See my separate article under Matabeleland South.</li>

    <li class="city">Filabusi (National Monument No. 56)</li>

   <li class="city">Mambo (National Monument No. 57)</li>

   <li class="city"> Fort Rixon (National Monument No. 58) south of Fort Rixon, sometimes called the Claremont Mine, or Cunningham Memorial, to the nine members of the Cunningham family.  See my separate article under Matabeleland South.</li></ol>

<p class="city">This Gweru Memorial was set up by the Pioneer Memorial Fund; this is not carved into the memorial, but does appear on the east facing metal plate beneath; however I have been unable to trace any further information about this Fund. The Memorial is made from the same red sandstone as the four above, with an obelisk set upon a plinth upon which the names being commemorated are carved. The article by C.K. Cooke makes no mention of the Gweru Memorial, although the similar style and materials suggest they are probably roughly contemporary.</p>

The views widen as the visitor ascends the large rounded granite kopje and on a clear day Danan’ombe is visible 22 Kilometres to the southwest.</p>
<p class="city">Naletale has undoubtedly the most magnificent decorated walls amongst the 300 dry-stone walled monuments to be found throughout Zimbabwe and the only ruin to have all types of patterning highlighted as banded iron-stone decorations.
Danan’ombe Monument, a few kilometres away, was once the capital of the Torwa State, often called Butua in early sixteenth Century maps and the central hut at Naletale in the 1550’s may well have been the home of a sub-chief ruled by the King at Danan’ombe  before it came to prominence in 1680.</p>

The area is virtually an undeveloped and unspoilt wilderness. Reminiscent in parts of the grass plains of East Africa, it is quite unlike any of the more familiar bush or woodlands.
The Park includes a series of pan depressions, some of which are continuously pumped from boreholes in the dry season. As a result, large concentrations of game seasonally migrate between Botswana and Zimbabwe, especially from September through to the first rains of November or December.</p>
<p class="city">Species to be seen include: lion, leopard, giraffe, zebra, gemsbok, roan, sable, tsessebe, eland and reedbuck, whilst elephant and buffalo are present in large numbers when water is scarce. White rhino are also often seen.
A special species endemic to the Kazuma Depression is the oribi, a small antelope, not often seen in other parts of the country. Visitors may also occasionally see cheetah or wild dog while lions are fairly common.
The pan systems are also ideal habitat to a large variety of water birds, with a number of species including storks, crowned cranes, stilts, cormorants, ducks and kingfishers occurring throughout the area.</p>

			   <h2 id="32" class="town">Plumtree</h2>
			   <p class="city">Plumtree is a small town in Zimbabwe. Alongside marula trees, wild plum trees ('umqokolo' in Botoko language) grew abundantly in the area, hence the name Plumtree.
			   
			   The town is located in Bulilimamangwe District, Matabeleland South Province, in southwestern Zimbabwe, at the international border with Botswana. It is located about 100 kilometres (62 mi), by road, southwest of Bulawayo, the nearest large city.

			   <h2 id="33" class="town">Rusape</h2>
			   <p class="city">Rusape is located in Makoni District in Manicaland Province, in northeastern Zimbabwe. It lies approximately 170 kilometres (110 mi), by road, southeast of Harare, the capital and the largest city in Zimbabwe. Rusape is situated on the main road (Highway A-3), between Harare and Mutare, approximately 94 kilometres (58 mi), further southeast of Rusape.</p>
			   
			   <p class="city">Tsanzaguru is home to much of Rusape's golden history. The name Tsanzaguru is derived from the Rozvi meaning of a big, rocky and tall hill from which the Rozvi were known to have wanted to build to the moon from there. They are said to have wanted to bring the moon to the King's Zunde Ramambo as a gift. It is from this background that all Chiefs countrywide have their badges designed in a circular form resembling the circular dream moon that the Rozvi wanted to bring their King. Typically noticeable in the surrounding region are the kopjes, msasa trees, occasional tobacco farms and the sometimes densely crowded rural resettlement villages.</p>

<p class="city">Rusape's main piped water supply is from the purpose-built Rusape Dam, which was built on the Rusape River. The river runs in a northwest to southeast direction on the town outskirts. It is such a big river that the dam was planned with the eastern lowveld sugar-growing areas in mind. Ideally, Rusape dam was to be a reservoir for irrigation in areas deep down around Triangle and Chiredzi since it pours out into the Save River to the semi-arid regions.It is known for its game resrves and parks.</p>

<p class="city">There is also a ceremonial painting of the rock paintings at Diana's Vow.The name "Rusape" was derived from the word rusapwe which means may it never dry, with reference to the ever-flowing waters of the Rusape River, adjacent to the town. Because there are no other perennial streams in its vicinity, it would be a disaster if the river dried.

<h3 id="40" class="small">Sapi and Chewore Safari Area</h3>
<p class="city">An area of unsurpassed beauty, Sapi and Chewore Safari area offers abundant wildlife viewing opportunities, superb fishing and photographic safari activities. This is also a hunting area however most visitors come here for the some of the finest fresh water fishing opportunities available in Africa.The Chewore and Sapi Safari Area is one of three UNESCO World Heritage Sites situated along The Zambezi Valley. This valley which runs along the border between northern Zimbabwe and Zambia is one of the largest, most remote, least populated areas on planet earth. Accessible only by air or 4X4 vehicle the area is a pristine untamed wilderness area teeming with wildlife.</p>
 
<p class="city"><b>Fishing</b><br>
Due to the deep waters of the Zambezi river here, it offers excellent fishing conditions. As well as the mighty tiger fish, often caught here are Catfish, Bream, Giant Vundu, Bottlenose, Cornish Jack, Chessa and Nkupe. Most of the best fishing spots on the Zambezi River can be accessed by boat, including the famous Mupata Gorge, where the river narrows and the flow is deep and swift.</p>
<b>Bird Viewing</b><br>
Chewore offers diverse bird viewing opportunities with habitats such as wetlands, thornveld, bushveld, savannah and riverine forest.

Inland, in the remote, wild southern section of the South Chewore Safari Area, there is a trackway of rose-colored sandstone with spectacular fossil footprints made by the dinosaur Allosaurus discovered in a riverbed. The small footprint size implies that it is a trackway of a juvenile, a probable carnosaur.</p>

			  <p class="city">Tuli is a village in the province of Matabeleland South, Zimbabwe. It is located about 90 km west of Beitbridge on the eastern bank of the Shashe River. The village grew around Fort Tuli, which was the first settlement built by the Pioneer Column in July 1890 at the place known as Selous Camp and used by Frederick Selous as a base for his hunting expeditions. The village is mainly a police post and associated housing. The village can be accessed from Gwanda town via Guyu and Hwali, or from Beitbridge via Nottingham and Shashi Irrigation Scheme, although the latter road is in very poor condition.</p>
			  
			  <p class="city">Tuli also forms the centre of a 10-mile 'circle', the southern half of which stretches south of the Shashe River. This circle was established by the early pioneers with the agreement of local tribesmen as a no-go area for the grazing of local cattle. This preserved the grazing and helped to prevent the spread of rinderpest from the local cattle to the all important oxen needed for the trek north. The historic legacy of this, being that the international boundary separating Zimbabwe from Botswana ceases to be the Shashe River for the section where it flows through the 'circle' and the "Tuli Circle" as it became known, was formed. This is a protected area, now the Thuli Parks and Wildlife Land.

<p class="city">The National (A8) road from Bulawayo is generally in good condition with some bumpy parts near Bulawayo, but smooth tar thereafter.</p>

<p class="city"><b>The Kwekwe – Lupane road shortcut</b><br>
The following is from an anonymous source on Bambazonke :<br> 

What most people do not know is that there are 2 roads from Nkayi to Lupane, the main (shorter)road with the broken bridge, and another which runs parallel about 12 KM north of it. This alternate route adds about 15 KM to the journey, but is in much better condition. As it runs along the Shangani River, is also more populated, with villages and homesteads along its whole length. All two wheel drive vehicles now use this road as it is passable at all times (a few occasionally flooded rivers aside). The details which follow will guide you along this road:<br>

<i>Kwekwe- Lupane</i><br>

In Kwekwe town, traveling south, turn right to Nkayi just before the second traffic circle (it is signposted) Fuel is available at the Puma fuel station on the left, as Lupane does not always have fuel. The first 6 KM is badly broken up tar to the Green Mountain lodge, after which it improves. You come to a crossroads about 15 KM from Kwekwe, turn left to Nkayi as there are no signs. The narrow tar after the crossroads is in good condition and potholes are mostly filled. After about 40 KM of narrow tar, the road turns to corrugated gravel for about 30 KM before becoming wide tar from Silobela to Nkayi. At the Nkayi crossroads, turn right into Nkayi and follow the signs to the hospital. It will take you left past the airstrip and the hospital through the business centre. About 15 KM from Nkayi you come to a crossroads to Dakamela. Continue straight on through the crossroads for about 110 KM and it will bring you back onto the main Lupane-Nkayi road at a T junction about 20 KM from Lupane at Cross Feya General Dealer. Turn right to go to Lupane.</p>

<p class="city">Lupane Total fuel station has been refurbished and is operational, but they do not take cards. If they have no fuel, you may be able to buy from CMED depot. Both roads are recognized on Garmin Nuvi map software, so once you are on the right road, it will continue to follow it.</p>

<i>Lupane - Kwekwe</i><br>
Coming from Lupane towards Nkayi, watch for the blue store on the left called Cross Feya General Dealer, 20 KM from Lupane and turn left immediately after it. This alternative road is about 15-20 KM longer, but is in better condition than the main route, less punishing on vehicles, less isolated and one does not have to cross the river bed at the broken bridge.</p>

<p class="city">Cell phone coverage:<br>

There is Econet coverage at Kwekwe, Nkayi and Lupane, but you will lose it once you are more than 5 KM from any of these centers and there is no coverage along the road itself.</p>

<p class="city">Time & distance:<br>

Kwekwe to Nkayi is approx. 100 KM and will take around 1.5 hours. Nkayi to Lupane is approx. 120 km and will take at least 2 hours. Work on 4 hours for the whole 220 KM trip.Although it is a shorter distance than going via Bulawayo, for most occasional travellers it is questionable if there is much advantage to taking this route.</p>
		
		<h3 id="38" class="small">"The Victoria Falls Bridge</h3>
<p class="city">Spectacular views from the bridge towards the boiling pot as the Zambezi River surges down the first gorge.</p>

<p class="city">Constructing the bridge was a remarkable achievement in 1904-5 which required great organisational ability to bring all the materials from the UK and assemble the engineering team in this spot where wild animals still roamed. At the time it was the highest bridge above water level in the world.</p>

<p class="city">Construction took 14 months and the final join was done at dawn because the sun’s heat the previous day had caused the steel trusses to expand about 1¼ inches (3.2 cm), but at dawn they fitted perfectly.</p>

			  <p class="city">Zvishavane is a mining town in Midlands Province, Zimbabwe. Surrounded by low hills, it lies 97 kilometres west of Masvingo, on the main Bulawayo-Masvingo road. Other roads lead from Zvishavane to Gweru, 121 kilometres north, and Mberengwa, 27 kilometres south-west. It is also on direct rail links to Gweru and Beit Bridge which then link up with Harare and Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and to Maputo in Mozambique, and Pretoria in South Africa. It has a private airport serving the city.</p>
			  
			  <p class="city">Zvishavane was formerly called Shabanie (used by the mine) or Shabani (used for the town). The name "Shabanie" has been said to be derived from "shavani", a Ndebele word meaning "finger millet", or "trading together".</p>

<p class="city">Zvishavane is a Shona name, which is said to be derived from "zvikomo zvishava", which means "red hills". The name means "reddish or 'reddened' hills", referring to the many surrounding low hills that are characterised by red soil.</p>

<p class="city">The town developed as a residential centre for Shabani Mine, which started operations in 1916 to supply asbestos during the First World War. Growth was slow due to poor communications until the railway reached the town in 1928. Although the asbestos mine is the biggest producer of the mineral in Zvishavane, platinum, gold, beryl, chromite, iron ore at Buchwa and huge deposits of diamond at Murowa are also mined in the area.</p>

<p class="city">The surrounding area is dominated by cattle ranching, while peasant agriculture is practiced in the nearby communal lands of Mberengwa and Buchwa.
